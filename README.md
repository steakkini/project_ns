This is a prototype implementation for password hardening based on the paper "Password hardening based on keystroke dynamics"
by Fabian Monrose, Michael K. Reiter and Susanne Wetzel (Springer-Verlag, 2001).

Just run bcs_main.py and follow the instructions. 

Disclaimer:
There are still a lot of bugs and a demo mode (reading features from a text file) is under construction.
